# Session Fix Summary - 2025-10-10

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 🔴 Issue 1: Data Collection Periodic Execution Not Starting
**Root Cause**: Missing `await` keywords for async storage methods
**Files**: `agents/data_collection/agent.py`
**Lines**: 172, 178, 184

**Problem**:
```python
self._store_ohlcv(symbol, latest)  # Missing await
self._store_ticker(symbol, ticker)  # Missing await  
self._store_orderbook(symbol, orderbook)  # Missing await
```

**Solution**:
```python
await self._store_ohlcv(symbol, latest)
await self._store_ticker(symbol, ticker)
await self._store_orderbook(symbol, orderbook)
```

**Impact**: 
- Agent was initializing but storage coroutines were never executed
- RuntimeWarning: "coroutine was never awaited"
- Data was not being stored to InfluxDB

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - All async methods now properly awaited

### 🟡 Issue 2: InfluxDB Query API Mismatch  
**Status**: ❌ **FALSE ALARM** - API is correct

**Investigation**:
- Session notes claimed `query()` method didn't exist
- Verification showed `async def query()` exists at line 242 in `influxdb.py`
- Risk manager code correctly uses `await self._influx.query()`
- No actual issue with InfluxDB client usage

## Verification Results

### Data Collection Agent ✅
```
✅ REST polling every 30s
✅ OHLCV fetched and stored
✅ Ticker fetched and stored  
✅ Orderbook fetched and stored
✅ No RuntimeWarnings
✅ All 3 symbols: BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, SOL/USDT
```

### Signal Generation ✅
```sql
SELECT symbol, signal_type, confidence, created_at 
FROM signals 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '10 minutes'
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

# Results: 10 signals generated (BTC, ETH, SOL)
# Frequency: Every ~1 minute per symbol
# All agents operational: technical_analysis → strategy → risk_manager
```

## Commits

1. **f0f868c** - `fix(DEV-71): Add missing await for async storage methods in data collection`
2. **efbef52** - `fix(DEV-71): Add missing await for orderbook storage`

## Deployment

- **Method**: rsync + agent restart
- **Target**: mac-mini production environment
- **Status**: ✅ Deployed and verified
- **Log file**: `/tmp/data_collector.log`

## System Status

### Running Agents
```
✅ data_collection.agent  - PID: [new]
✅ technical_analysis.agent - PID: 32138
✅ strategy.agent - PID: 53159
✅ risk_manager.agent - PID: 54906
✅ execution.agent - PID: 70543
```

### Infrastructure
```
✅ RabbitMQ - Connected
✅ PostgreSQL - Connected  
✅ InfluxDB - Connected
✅ Binance Exchange - Connected
```

### Data Flow
```
Data Collection (30s) → InfluxDB → Technical Analysis (1m) 
→ Strategy Agent → Risk Manager → (Waiting for high-confidence signals)
```

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. Monitor for 24 hours to ensure stability
2. Review signal quality and confidence thresholds
3. Analyze why most signals are SELL (market condition or bias?)
4. Consider re-enabling WebSocket streams (DEV-71 M2)

## Time Taken

- Investigation: 15 min
- Fixes: 10 min  
- Testing & Deployment: 10 min
- **Total**: ~35 minutes

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always check async/await**: Python won't error on missing await, just warns
2. **Session notes can be outdated**: Verify claims before fixing
3. **Test locally first**: Quick iteration with test scripts
4. **Logs are essential**: Production logs showed the exact issue immediately
